Classiq makes use of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) solver and states that the circuit can be formulated as a graph. We believe this a well thought out approach and see its benefits for quantum circuit design. For exploration purposes over the search space of quantum circuits we might see problems that the user still has to perform some overhead work to correctly specify their problem for the circuit designer offered by Classiq. Also the co-design between hardware and the software stack could lead to problems already defining constraints and a mathematical formulation which might already restrict the search space for appropriate circuit designs.
